# Oshirase

A minimal notification daemon that doesn't get in your way. Its primary feature
is that except for the close and activation buttons, notifications can be
clicked straight through, meaning they don't get in the way of your favorite
activity â€” clicking the top right corner of the screen.

For some reason it displays &amp;quot; instead of the actual characters. I don't
know how to solve that.
